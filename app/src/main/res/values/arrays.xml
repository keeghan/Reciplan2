            1 1/2 cups black-eyed peas\n
            medium onion\n
            1 inch piece ginger\n
            1/2 to 1 scotch bonnet pepper (or habanero pepper)\n
            1/2 cup water (to blend)\n

            1.	Prepare the beans by soaking and de-hulling two days in advance.\n\n
            2.	Place the beans into a sturdy blender and begin to pulse until smooth. Add 1/4 cup of water at a time to facilitate the blending process.\n\n
